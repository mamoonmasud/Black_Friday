For this project, we are trying to predict user behaviour (Amount spent), based on data from similar users. Our training data has 550068 entries, with multiple entries for the same user, and the test data having 233599 entries. First, data is cleaned, and we explore the features using visualization. 
After that, we train different Algorithms to predict customer behavior. The following algorithms are trained: <br />
1: Linear Regression<br />
2: Decision Tree Regreesor<br />
3: CatBoost Regressor<br />

We also plot the top 5 most important features, as per the trained model of CatBoost!
